# TrickyTacT
Simple TicTacToe in c++ using SDL

This code from 2008 was for testing developing with `sdl1`, `sdl_image` and `sdl_ttf` in c++ using Xcode.

Some of the code... I don't like it now some big functions on the header file... at that time I might have been thinking about _optimization_.

**I don't know if the code compiles with updated tools**
